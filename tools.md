# PowerNSX based tools

PowerNSX has been released for almost a year. It has been a fantastic ride thus far. What started off as a little project by Nick has resulted in lots of administrators around the world using PowerNSX in many different ways. Some of the tools we have seen are superb and this page here serves as a reference.  Here is a shoutout to some of them. This list will be updated periodically.
